## What is that?

Why, it's an array of rainbow pressure plates! Take a step, I dare you.
It plays lots of music and sounds, complete with jump scares.

## How did you do it?

My brother built the thing and I programmed it. It is modeled after
one of the games from Squid Game. The program had to be completed
before it was built due to time constraints, so I created an emulator
GUI.

## Can I use it?

Yes. Enjoy.

## Okay, what I meant to ask is HOW to do you use it.

Glad you asked! Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/isaact23/squidgame`
then run it with `python3 main.py`. Press space to start the game,
then use the left/right arrow keys to choose tiles. You may
have to `pip3 install <missing module>` a few times.

## I have more questions!

Feel free to open an issue! I'll try to respond promptly.
